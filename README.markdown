## dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine. The very
prejudiced mix: OS X, Linux, Windows, zsh, Bash Ruby, Rails, git, homebrew, rvm, vim. 
If you match up along most of those lines, you may dig my dotfiles.

If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are
awesome, you might want to [read my post on the
subject](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

## install

For windows users make sure you are running under admin mode and have bash installed.

```bash
curl https://raw.github.com/clwillingham/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
```

This will clone the repo and symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your
home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`,
though.

The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.

## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` or `.bash` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `rake install`.

## thanks

Fork of [Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) which has been supported to work
on all 3 major OS - Mac OSX, Linux and Windows and of coure my own customizations.
